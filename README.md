# JobTracker
This is an application of my own design. When given an excel template to aid in tracking jobs that I have 
applied for, I thought, why not make an application that could do this all for me!
This project required a lot of individual study of XAML and the MVVM model in order to construct it.
This is what I have so far as it is still currently being built! The T-SQL database scripts have not been added at this time.
